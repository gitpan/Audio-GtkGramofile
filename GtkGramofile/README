Audio-GtkGramofile version 0.07
===============================

Audio::GtkGramofile provides the functionality to enable the enclosed 
script, gtkgramofile. The script gives a Gtk2 front end to the 
libgramofile library, which allows large .wav files to be split, and 
then a variety of different signal processing algorithms can be 
applied to the resultant (smaller) .wav files.

See: http://www.opensourcepartners.nl/~costar/gramofile/ for details of
Gramofile, upon which this is based.

See: http://sourceforge.net/projects/libgramofile/ for the library
derived from Gramofile, and Audio::Gramofile.
